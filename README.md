# DANNeCognitiveLibrary
My journey to building a C# library for artificial neural network. I am inspired by Daniel Shiffman of the YouTube channel The Coding Train. I am a software developer working for Accenture Philippines. I have very small scope of knowledge in other languages and have been in the comfort zone of .NET framework for years now. Becuase of that, I am trying to write the library on C# since it the language that I am comfortable with. However in the future, as I learn more about machine learning and neural networks, I will eventually get out of my comfort zone and try doing this in Python.

This repo has two C# projects. The first one contains the library and the other one (XORProblem) is a simple console application that learns the pattern of XOR truth table. It's basically the hello world of the NN.

Thank you for your time dropping by.
